Bez obzira na dob, spol ili razinu iskustva, naš klub će vas podržati na svakom koraku.","q3":"Kako powerlifting utječe na moje tijelo?","a3":"Powerlifting povećava snagu, poboljšava gustoću mišića i kostiju te unapređuje vašu tjelesnu kompoziciju, čineći vas jačim i izdržljivijim.","q4":"Pomaže li powerlifting u mršavljenju?","a4":"Da, powerlifting može pomoći u mršavljenju jer podizanje teških utega povećava potrošnju kalorija i ubrzava metabolizam, čak i nakon treninga.","q5":"Je li powerlifting dobar za starije osobe?","a5":"Definitivno. Powerlifting jača mišiće i kosti, što je ključno za održavanje mobilnosti i smanjenje rizika od ozljeda kod starijih osoba.","q6":"Koliko često trebam trenirati?","a6":"To ovisi o vašim ciljevima i rasporedu. Obično se preporučuju 3-5 treninga tjedno za optimalan napredak.","q7":"Koje su dobne kategorije u powerliftingu?","a7":"Powerlifting ima više dobnih kategorija: <ul> <br> <li>Kadet: do 18 godina</li> <li>Junior: 19-23 godine</li> <li>Senior/Open: 24-39 godina</li> <li>Masters: 40 godina i stariji (podijeljeni u dobne podkategorije: Masters I, II, III itd.)</li> </ul>","q8":"Koje su težinske kategorije u powerliftingu?","a8":"Težinske kategorije su sljedeće: <ul> <br> <li>Muškarci: 59 kg, 66 kg, 74 kg, 83 kg, 93 kg, 105 kg, 120 kg, 120+ kg </li> <li>Žene: 47 kg, 52 kg, 57 kg, 63 kg, 69 kg, 76 kg, 84 kg, 84+ kg</li> </ul>","q9":"Kako se prijaviti za natjecanje?","a9":"Prijava za natjecanje vrši se putem saveza ili organizatora natjecanja.

Ostala oprema, poput remena, steznika za koljena i zapešća, nije obavezna, ali se može koristiti ako želite dodatnu podršku ili sigurnost.","q11":"Kada se provodi vaganje?","a11":"Vaganje se provodi 2 sata prije početka natjecanja. To je obavezan proces gdje se utvrđuje vaša težinska kategorija. Nakon vaganja imate dovoljno vremena za obrok, rehidrataciju i pripremu prije početka natjecanja.","q12":"Što znači moto kluba \'Klub iznad svega\'?","a12":"Moto \'Klub iznad svega\' odražava našu filozofiju da niti jedan pojedinac nije važniji od kluba.
